Project Description: The construction website that I have made is for Vastushilp Constructions, which is one of the leading and fastest growing firms in Ahmednagar. The construction group continuously strives to make lives calm and tranquil by providing ideal homes. The different bungalows and apartments are constructed and built by this construction group. It offers customers the opportunity to find the best home at the best price by offering different services. People can buy houses within their budgets as it provides different offers at the time of booking the flat. People can see the status of different projects, whether the scheme is ready to move or has some time to complete the construction project. On the construction website, I have used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. On my website, I have about, home, contact, and projects pages. People can connect with the construction group by providing the details. People can ask questions if they have any. It looks like a professional website. I am trying to solve a real world problem, like how these days people don't get the right information about the prices of houses in different areas and can get trapped by fraudsters. So I made a Web app where I am trying to give all the correct information about the construction projects. My website helps people who want to buy a home within their budget. I have provided detailed information about projects that were constructed earlier, new upcoming schemes, and information about the firm so customers can easily relate to the real world.
